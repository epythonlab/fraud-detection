# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Banking

This project utilizes machine learning to detect fraudulent activity in e-commerce and banking transactions. The model facilitates data-driven decisions for enhanced security and risk management.

## Project Directory Structure

The repository is well-organized for efficient development:

* **`.github/workflows/`**: Automates tasks like testing through GitHub Actions.
* **`.vscode/`**: Enhances the development experience with configurations for Visual Studio Code.
* **`app/`**: Contains the API implementation for interacting with the machine learning model via RESTful endpoints.
* **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks are used for exploring data, feature engineering, and initial model exploration.
* **`scripts/`**: Python scripts handle data preprocessing, feature extraction, visualization, and model implementation.
* **`tests/`**: Unit tests ensure the model and data processing logic function correctly.
