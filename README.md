## Project Tasks and Workflow

### Task 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation or removal of missing data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates and correcting data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Univariate and bivariate analysis.
- **Geolocation Analysis**: 
  - Convert IP addresses to integers.
  - Merge `Fraud_Data.csv` with `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Transaction frequency and velocity.
  - Time-based features (hour of day, day of week).
- **Normalization and Scaling**
- **Encoding Categorical Features**

### Task 2 - Model Building and Training
- **Data Preparation**: Feature and target separation, and train-test split.
- **Model Selection**:
  - Classical models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
  - Advanced models: Gradient Boosting, MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Train on both `creditcard` and `Fraud_Data` datasets.
- **MLOps**: 
  - Use MLflow for versioning, experiment tracking, and model comparison.

### Task 3 - Model Explainability
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**:
  - Explain feature importance using SHAP summary, force, and dependence plots.
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**:
  - Generate feature importance plots for individual predictions.

### Task 4 - Model Deployment and API Development
- **Setting Up the Flask API**:
  - Serve models via Flask in `serve_model.py`.
- **Dockerization**:
  - Create a Docker container for the API with a `Dockerfile`.
  - Run the container with:
    ```bash
    docker build -t fraud-detection-model .
    docker run -p 5000:5000 fraud-detection-model
    ```
- **Logging**:
  - Use Flask-Logging to monitor requests and track predictions.

### Task 5 - Dashboard Development with Flask and Dash
- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Visualize fraud insights (transaction count, fraud cases, geographic data).
  - Use Dash to create charts (line, bar) and summary boxes for fraud trends.
  - Set up a Flask endpoint to serve fraud data for the Dash frontend.
